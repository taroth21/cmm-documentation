            <title>Building Dashboards</title>
            <p>Each metrics dashboard is composed of one or more panels that are arranged in one or more rows. A row serves as a logical divider within a dashboard. It organizes your panels in groups. The panel is the basic building block for visualizing your metrics data.</p>
            <p>For building dashboards, you have two options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start from scratch and create a new dashboard.</li>
                <li>Take the dashboard that is shipped with <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> as a starting point and customize it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections provide introductory information on dashboards, rows, and panels, and make you familiar with the first steps involved in building a dashboard. For additional information, you can also refer to the <xref

            <title>Creating a Dashboard</title>
            <p>To create a new dashboard, you use <uicontrol>Open Dashboard</uicontrol> in the top right corner of your dashboard window. The option provides access to various features for administrating dashboards. Use <uicontrol>New</uicontrol> to create an empty dashboard that serves as a starting point for adding rows and panels.</p>
            <fig>
                <image
                    alt="grafana-cmm.png" height="260"
                    href="../../images/grafana-emptydb.png"
            width="435"/>
            </fig>
            <p>On the left side of an empty dashboard, there is a green rectangle displayed. Hover over this rectangle to access a <uicontrol>Row</uicontrol> menu. To insert your first panel, you can use the options in the <uicontrol>Add Panel</uicontrol> submenu. See below for details on the available panel types.</p>
            <p>As soon as you have inserted an empty panel, you can add additional rows. For this purpose, use the <uicontrol>Add Row</uicontrol> option on the right side of the dashboard.</p>
        </section>
        <section
            id="Editing_Rows_concept_conbody_section_6">
            <title>Editing Rows</title>
            <p>Features for editing rows can be accessed via the green rectangle that is displayed to the left of each row. </p>
            <p>In addition to adding panels to a row, you can collapse or remove a row, move the position of the row within your dashboard, or set the row height. Row settings allows you, for example, to insert a row title or to hide the <uicontrol>Row</uicontrol> menu so that the row can no longer be edited.</p>
        </section>
        <section
                    id="Editing_Panels_concept_conbody_section_7">
            <title>Editing Panels</title>
            <p>Grafana distinguishes between three panel types:</p>
            <fig>
                <image alt="grafana-cmm.png" height="260" href="../../images/grafana-panels.png" width="435"/>
            </fig>
            <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Graph</uicontrol> are used to visualize metrics data. A query editor is provided to define the data to be visualized. The editor allows you to combine multiple queries. This means that any number of metrics and data series can be visualized in one panel.</p>
            <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Singlestat</uicontrol> are also used to visualize metrics data, yet they reduce a single query to a single number. The single number can be, for example, the minimum, maximum, average, or sum of values of the data series. The single number can be translated into a text value, if required.</p>
            <p>Panels of type <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol> are used to insert static text. The text may, for example, provide information for the dashboard users. Text panels are not connected to any metrics data. </p>
            <p>As soon as you have added a panel to your dashboard, you can access the options for editing the panel content. For this purpose, click the panel title and use <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>For panels of type <uicontrol>Text</uicontrol>, a simple text editor is displayed for entering text. Plain text, HTML, and markdown format are supported.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For panels of type <uicontrol>Graph</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Singlestat</uicontrol>, a query editor is displayed to define which data it to be shown. You can add multiple metrics, and apply functions to the metrics. The query results will be visualized in your panel in real time. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A large number of display and formatting features are provided to customize how the content is presented in a panel. Click the panel title to access the corresponding options. The menu that is displayed also allows you to duplicate or remove a panel. To change the size of a panel, click the <uicontrol>+</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>-</uicontrol> icons.</p>
            <p>You can move panels on your dashboard by simply dragging and dropping them within and between rows.</p>
            <p>By default, the time range for panels is controlled by dashboard settings. Use the time picker in the top right corner of your dashboard window to define relative or absolute time ranges. You can also set an auto-refresh interval, or manually refresh the data that is displayed. </p>

            <p>To save a dashboard, use <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> in the top right corner of your dashboard window. You can enter a name for the dashboard and simply save it to your browser's local storage. Use <uicontrol>Dashboard JSON</uicontrol> to directly view the corresponding JSON syntax, or use <uicontrol>Export dashboard</uicontrol>  to download the JSON file.
