                <section>
            <p>For managing the log data of your services and the virtual and physical servers on which they are provisioned, <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> integrates with Kibana, an open source analytics and visualization platform. <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> uses Kibana as a front-end application to the log data held in the Elasticsearch database. </p>
            <p>Kibana allows you to easily understand large data volumes. Based on the data that is stored in Elasticsearch indices, you can perform advanced data analysis and visualize your log data in a variety of charts, tables, or maps. Changes to the Elasticsearch indices are displayed in <ph
                    conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> in real time.</p>
            <p>The log management features of <ph conref="../../shared/product-name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Features for searching, visualizing, and analyzing the log data.</li>
                <li>Alerting features for monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the following sections, you will find information on the log management window where you search, visualize, and analyze your log data, as well as details on how to use the alerting features.</p>
