                        <p>As an OpenStack operator, you also install and configure the agents you use for monitoring your OpenStack services. Your application operators who have booked a virtual machine in OpenStack monitor their machine with libvirt. As an OpenStack operator, you have to make the required libvirt preparations for them.
